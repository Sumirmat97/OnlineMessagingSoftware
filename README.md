It is an online chat application made in php as backend.

The users have to register/signin to to enter into the application.
They then can search for friends and send send them friend requests.
Once the requests are accepted two people can chat.

The user can put a profile picture and a status. 

Emoticons require net connection (as we have integrated using Emojione project)

Messages can be starred and starred messages can be seen separately.
Individual messages can be deleted. For both of these an interactive and easy to use GUI is provided.

Users can chat in incognito mode. The mode deletes the messages sent by the user after the user signs out.
